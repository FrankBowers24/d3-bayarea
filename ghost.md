Are you new to the Bay Area?  Are you curious about where to find affordable housing?  Do you want to get a better understanding of the Bay Area's diversity?

[Bay Area Stats](http://FrankBowers24.github.io) offers a graphical view of Bay Area demographic and housing data that lets you easily compare the characteristics of zip codes or cities.

### Features

1.  Click, pan and zoom the map
2.  Enter a city name or zip code and click Select
3.  Change the menu to see Race/Ethnicity
4.  Select Race: Asian and select Asian nationalities
5.  Notice how the pie chart changes when you click on different zip code regions.  The pie chart changes are most interesting when the change in data is greatest.  Select Race/Ethnicity or Race/Asian/Mainland Chinese and click between Daly City and Berkeley.
6.  If you are running the Chrome browser on a Macintosh and enable the microphone you can give it voice commands. Commands include "go to <city or zip code>", "Show me income", "Show me race", "Show me homes", "Show me condos", "Show me housing types".

## Inspirations and How To

While perusing the D3 examples I came across a labeled pie chart which has animated transitions from one dataset to another.  I was immediately captivated.  This is eye candy that needs a real world application.  Many of the D3 examples lack compeling data to make them relevant.  Data at the state or county level is often too general to be interesting.  I searched through federal government data at the zip code level and found insights that truly drew me.

To create a zip code map I converted Census Bureau shapefiles using


Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:

* Item number one
* Item number two
    * A nested item
* A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.

### What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

{<1>}![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.

> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }

### Ready for a Break? 

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" />

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
